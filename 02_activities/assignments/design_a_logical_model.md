# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

ANSWER:
Logical Model for a Small Bookstore
Entities and Relationships

1. Book
Columns:
BookID (PK)
Title
Author
ISBN
Price
StockQuantity
Genre

2. Customer
Columns:
CustomerID (PK)
FirstName
LastName
Email
PhoneNumber

3. Order
Columns:
OrderID (PK)
CustomerID (FK)
OrderDate
TotalAmount

4. Sales
Columns:
SaleID (PK)
OrderID (FK)
BookID (FK)
Quantity
SalePrice

5. Employee
Columns:
EmployeeID (PK)
FirstName
LastName
Position
HireDate

6. Date
Columns:
DateID (PK)
Date
Month
Year
DayOfWeek

***Relationships:
Customer (1) to Order (M)
Order (1) to Sales (M)
Book (1) to Sales (M)
Employee (1) to Order (M) (if employees process orders)

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

ANSWER:
Employee Shifts
To add employee shifts, we can create a new entity:

Employee_Shift
Columns:
ShiftID (PK)
EmployeeID (FK)
ShiftDate
ShiftTime (e.g., Morning, Evening)

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```

```

ANSWER
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS Table Architectures

1. Type 1 Architecture (Overwrite):
Table Structure:
CustomerID (PK, FK)
AddressLine1
AddressLine2
City
State
ZipCode
This approach simply overwrites the existing address.

2.Type 2 Architecture (Retain Changes):
Table Structure:
AddressID (PK)
CustomerID (FK)
AddressLine1
AddressLine2
City
State
ZipCode
EffectiveDate
ExpirationDate
This maintains a history of addresses, allowing tracking of changes over time.

Bonus: Privacy Implications
Yes, there are privacy implications related to storing customer addresses. Retaining historical address data (Type 2) could potentially expose sensitive information if not managed properly. Data breaches could lead to unauthorized access to personal information, requiring robust security measures and compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer...
```

ANSWER:

Comparison with AdventureWorks Schema

Differences:
1. Complexity: The AdventureWorks schema is significantly more complex, with many more entities like products, categories, suppliers, and detailed order processes. My ERD is simpler, focusing only on the bookstore's primary functions.

2. Normalizations: AdventureWorks employs a higher degree of normalization with many related tables (e.g., for sales territories, promotions). My model keeps it straightforward, which may simplify operations but could lead to data redundancy.

Changes: While my model meets the bookstore's needs, incorporating some elements of normalization from AdventureWorks could improve data integrity and reporting capabilities, especially for future scalability.
