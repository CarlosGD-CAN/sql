**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

ANSWER:
Reflecting on the SQL exercises I completed, it’s essential to recognize that while technical skills are crucial, ethical considerations and the awareness of inequities in data usage are equally important. In any data management task, including SQL queries, we must consider how our data practices can impact individuals and communities. For example, when using CROSS JOINs, which can significantly increase row counts, it’s vital to ensure that the resulting datasets do not inadvertently misrepresent or over-generalize vendor revenues. This could lead to misleading conclusions about the financial viability of small vendors versus larger ones, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in the market.

Additionally, when creating and managing tables, such as the product_units table, ethical considerations arise regarding data collection and representation. We must ask ourselves: Are we fairly representing all products, or are we favoring certain items due to biases in data selection? Ensuring inclusivity in the data we collect, such as considering products from underrepresented vendors, is key to fostering equity. Furthermore, the decisions made during data deletion, like removing older records, should be approached carefully to avoid losing important historical context that may affect vendors' narratives.

Moreover, in updating records, such as aligning current_quantity with the latest values, it's crucial to maintain transparency about where this data originates. If certain products or vendors are consistently favored due to their visibility in the database, it might perpetuate biases that disadvantage smaller or less prominent vendors. Therefore, developing an ethical framework that includes checks for bias, ensuring diverse representation, and prioritizing transparency will enhance the integrity of data practices in SQL and beyond. By embedding these ethical considerations into our data management processes, we can contribute to a more equitable landscape for all stakeholders involved.
